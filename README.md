# VR-Mini-Golf

Open in Unity editor.
Click play.
There's a golf ball in level 1 that falls from the sky to go to level 2. This is for our presentation, as I'm not confident we can get a hole in one/two on the first try. To play disable it if you would like, or set Y position to 20 and activate in inspector when you want level 2.

We know this game is kind of broken. Switching the entire project with only 24 hrs remaining to work on was not the best idea, but this way it at least kind of works. I may reattempt VR Foosball in the near future as well as remaking this game (VR Mini Golf) albeit the proper way. 8 hrs work + 16 hrs troubleshooting = here you go!
